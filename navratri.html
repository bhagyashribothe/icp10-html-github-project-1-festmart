    <H3>Navaratri is a Hindu festival that spans nine nights (and ten days) and is celebrated every year in the autumn. It is observed for different reasons and celebrated differently in various parts of the Indian subcontinent. Theoretically, there are four seasonal Navaratri.
         However, in practice, it is the post-monsoon autumn festival called Sharada Navaratri</H3>
