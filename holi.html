            <h2>HOLI :-</h2>
            <B>Holi is particularly enjoyed by worshippers of the god Krishna. Its general frivolity is considered to be in imitation of Krishna’s play with the gopis (wives and daughters of cowherds) as recounted in the Bhagavata Purana and Gitagovinda. The association of Holi with their playfulness comes from another text called the Garga Samhita. 
<br>
<H2>CELEBRATION :-</H2>
<b>In most of the country, Holi is celebrated at the end of winter, around the full moon in March. On the full moon night (Holi eve), large bonfires are lit to mark the occasion and to burn evil spirits. This is known as Holika Dahan. In 2021, Holi is on March 29, with Holika Dahan on March 28. </b>
